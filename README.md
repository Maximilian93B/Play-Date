## Handling CORS Issues
If you encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues while running the app, consider using the "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin" extension for Chrome. This extension can help bypass CORS policies by modifying HTTP request headers. 

### Installation Guide for CORS Extension
1. Visit the Chrome Web Store.
2. Search for "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin".
3. Add the extension to your Chrome browser.
4. Enable the extension when running the app.

**Note:** This is a temporary solution for development purposes and should be used cautiously as it can have security implications.

## Known Issues
Google Maps may not work on GitHub Live version. Could be API Key issue. Clone repo and open in Chrome with Ext if you cannot see the Maps.
