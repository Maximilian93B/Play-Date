                        <br>
                        Hey, I'm Max. With a year of experience in development, I'm someone who aims high and matches it
                        with a
                        strong
                        work
                        ethic. My journey into this field was gradual; after years of dabbling and exploring, I found my
                        true
                        calling in
                        development when I decided to transition from military life to a new challenge. It was my
                        curiosity
                        that
                        led me
                        here,
                        and now I channel it into creating innovative solutions in the tech world.
                        I'm driven by high standards and a relentless pursuit of excellence, qualities that I believe
                        shine
                        through in
                        my work.
                        I thrive in small, specialized team environments where collaboration and expertise come together
                        to
                        make
                        magic
                        happen.
                        Thanks for checking out our app. I hope you enjoy what we've built as much as we've enjoyed
                        creating
                        it
                        for you!

                        <br>
                        Hey everyone, I'm Ikechukwu, but you can call me Ike. Based in New Brunswick, I've journeyed
                        through
                        tech,
                        starting as a
                        multimedia enthusiast before diving into desktop tech roles. My work's been about steering
                        digital
                        experiences, focusing
                        on meticulous details, and managing web content using various systems. I love playing and
                        watching
                        basketball and
                        football. I got in to the wed dev space in other to transform my career and fulfill my goal
                        of
                        becoming
                        a
                        software
                        engineer or web developer.

                            <strong>About:</strong>
                            <br>
                            Hey there, I'm Steph from the east coast of Canada. I began my journey in the IT space as a
                            social
                            media
                            manager. As I
                            naturally delved into testing our work, I discovered a passion for Software Testing.
                            Combining
                            this
                            newfound
                            interest
                            with my natural creativity, I decided to explore the exciting world of web development.

                            I'm enthusiastic about learning and eagerly anticipate where this journey will take me. My
                            hope
                            is
                            that
                            wherever I land,
                            I can contribute in a meaningful and impactful way. Currently, I'm focusing on [specific
                            aspect
                            or
                            technology in web
                            development]. Excited to see where this path leads!
